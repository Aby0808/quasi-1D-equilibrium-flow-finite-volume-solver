# Quasi-1D CFD Solver

Hobby project to improve the understanding of CFD and equilibrium flows.

Work-in-progress MATLAB implementation of a quasi-1D finite-volume solver
for compressible flows with area variation and source terms.

Current focus:
- Solver architecture
- Boundary condition framework
- Explicit time marching
